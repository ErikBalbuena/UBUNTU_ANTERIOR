        <p>
            We’ve seen with absolute positioning that it’s possible to remove elements from the normal
            flow of text. Floating allows you to move an element to one side of the screen; other content
            in the document then flows around the floated element. Figure 4.15 demonstrates how float-
            ing elements and the box model can be used to control the layout of an entire page.
            Looking at the HTML5 code, we can see that the general structure of this document
            consists of a header and two main sections. Each section contains an h1 subheading and
            a paragraph of text.
            Block-level elements (such as sections) render with a line break before and after their
            content, so the header and two sections will render vertically one on top of another. In
            the absence of our styles, the h1s that represent our subheadings would also stack vertically
            on top of the text in the p tags. However, in line 24 we set the float property to right in
            the class floated, which is applied to the h1 headings. This causes each h1 to float to the
            right edge of its containing element, while the paragraph of text will flow around it.

            margin and padding Properties
Line 16 assigns a margin of .5em to all paragraph elements. The margin property sets the
space between the outside of an element’s border and all other content on the page. Line
21 assigns .2em of padding to the floated h1s. The padding property determines the dis-
tance between the content inside an element and the inside of the element’s border. Mar-
gins for individual sides of an element can be specified (lines 17, 22 and 23) by using the
properties margin-top, margin-right, margin-left and margin-bottom. Padding can be
specified in the same way, using padding-top, padding-right, padding-left and pad-
ding-bottom. To see the effects of margins and padding, try putting the margin and pad-
ding properties inside comments and observing the difference.
In line 27, we assign a border to the section boxes using a shorthand declaration of
the border properties, which allow you to define all three border properties in one line.
The syntax for this shorthand is border: width style color
Our border is one pixel thick, solid, and the same color as the background-color prop-
erty of the header (line 10). This allows the border to blend with the header and makes
the page appear as one box with a line dividing its sections.
